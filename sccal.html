                operation of the calculator, using functions, and graphing. There are a lot of features to learn about,
                but getting the basics down will allow you to access pretty much any function! Scientific calculators
                are must-have tools for math classes like Algebra, Trigonometry, and Geometry. Compared to basic
                calculators, scientific calculators have more advanced math operations.</p>

                <p class="desc">Whenever you type a left parenthesis, you must close it with a right one; similarly, if you type a
                    total of five left parentheses, you'll have to close them with five right ones. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is important when entering larger calculations, as leaving out a parenthesis can cause the

                <ul>
                    <li>This is important when performing Trigonometry calculations. If you notice that your equations

                <p class="desc">Saving your results and pulling them back later is an essential skill for dealing with longer
                    problems.
                    There are a couple of different ways to use stored information: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After completing a calculation, the last answer is automatically stored. You can perform another
                        calculation on that answer by tying in the next operation. For example, if you just entered 2^4
                        and
                        pressed ENTER (which equals 16), typing in -10 and pressing ENTER would subtract 10 from the
                        solution (meaning it would be 16 - 10).</li>
                    <li>Use the Answer function to recall the last displayed answer to an equation. When you press the
                        Ans
                        key, the last answer from the previous calculation will be added into your equation.</li>
                    <li>Press STO after retrieving your preferred answer, press ALPHA, select a letter, and press ENTER.
                        You
                        can then use that letter as a placeholder for the answer you stored.[2] X R</li>
                    <li>Some scientific calculators allow you to retrieve previous answers by pressing the up arrow
                        button.
                        When you find the answer you were looking for, press ENTER to place that number in your current
                        equation. Note that there’s usually a limit to how many previous answers are stored, so you can
                        only
                        use this method for recent calculations.</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="desc">Test out the button order on an easy and quick problem. For example, you might try taking the square
                    root of 9; you should already know that the answer will be 3, so this is a great tip to use in the
                    middle of a test if you forget which order you're supposed to be pressing buttons: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the square root (√) symbol.</li>
                    <li>Either press the square root key or press the SHIFT or 2ND button and then press its key.</li>

                    entering the number to which you want to raise the first number. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, to calculate 22, you would type in 2^2 and then press ENTER or =.</li>
                    <li>To ensure the number order is correct, try performing a simple test, such as 23. If you get 8 as
                        the answer, then you did it in the right order. If you got 9, then you actually did 32.</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="desc">When you are using the SIN, COS, or TAN functions, you will have to keep in mind two different
                    things: the order of the button presses, and radians versus degrees. These scientific calculator
                    functions are commonly used in Algebra. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Perform a simple SIN function with an easy to remember answer. For example, the sine of 30° is
                        0.5.</li>
                    <li>On a scientific calculator, to find the sine of 30° for example, you type in 30, then press SIN
                        to get 0.5. If you got a different answer, it probably means that your scientific calculator is
                        not in degree mode. To put it in degree mode, look for a button that says DRG which stands for
                        Degrees, Radians, and Gradients. If you push the DRG button several times, you will see that the
                        mode in your view screen will change between degrees, radians, and gradients. Push the DRG
                        button until you see degrees or DEG indicated in the view screen. Once you have degrees in the
                        view screen, then type in 30 then press SIN and you should get 0.5.</li>

                    <li class="head"> Practice entering longer equations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="desc">Things can get a bit more complicated when you start entering longer equations into your calculator.
                    You will need to take order into consideration, and will often make use of the () keys. Try entering
                    the following equation into your calculator: 3^4/(3+(25/3+4*(-(1^2))))</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note how many parentheses are necessary to keep the formula intact. Proper parentheses use is
                        essential to successfully using the calculator.</li>
                    <li>Most calculators follow PEMDAS (parenthesis, exponent, multiplication, division, addition,
                        subtraction), but using parentheses is the most sure way to correctly calculate the equation.
                    </li>
                    <li>After you're done calculating for the day, you can try downloading games onto your calculator.

                </ul>
                <p class="desc">While things like SIN, square roots, inverse exponents, and pi are often either represented by keys
                    or secondary text above keys, you can find more advanced functions (e.g., factorials) in the MATH
                    menu. To use the MATH menu, do the following: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Press the MATH button.</li>
                    <li>Use the up and down arrows to scroll up and down through a category of equations.</li>
                    <li>Use the right and left arrows to scroll right and left through the different categories.</li>
                    <li>Press ENTER or = to select an equation, then enter the number or formula to which you want to
                        apply the equation</li>
                    <li>Press ENTER or = to calculate the whole equation. </li>
